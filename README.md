## üîç Matching Algorithm
- **Skills (50%):** Overlap between resume and job required skills
- **Experience (30%):** Years of experience vs. job requirement
- **Education (20%):** Education level vs. job requirement
- **Weighted Score:** Final match score is a weighted sum
- **Details:** Matching skills, experience, and education are shown for transparency

---

## üß© Customization
- **Add More Jobs:** Edit `jobs/management/commands/create_sample_jobs.py`
- **Change Matching Logic:** Edit `resumes/views.py` ‚Üí `create_job_matches()`
- **Add More Resume Fields:** Update `resumes/models.py` and forms/templates
- **Switch Database:** Update `DATABASES` in `resume_analyzer/settings.py`
- **Styling:** Edit templates in `templates/` and static files in `static/`

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Best Practices
- Uploaded files are validated for type and size
- User data is protected by Django's authentication system
- Admin-only actions are protected by permissions
- `.env` and sensitive files are gitignored

---

## üêû Troubleshooting
- **spaCy model not found:** Run `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`
- **File upload errors:** Check file type/size and permissions on `media/`
- **Migrations:** If you change models, run `makemigrations` and `migrate`
